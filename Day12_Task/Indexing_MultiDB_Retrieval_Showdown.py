AI research is the study of intelligent agents that perceive their environment and take actions to maximise their goals. Modern AI techniques include machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, robotics, and expert systems. Applications include search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, and generative AI tools. The term was coined at the 1956 Dartmouth Conference. Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test in 1950. The current wave began with deep learning breakthroughs around 2012. Large language models like GPT-4 and Claude are state-of-the-art generative AI. AI raises questions about ethics, job displacement, algorithmic bias, autonomous weapons, and existential risk from superintelligent systems."\n  },\n  {\n    "title": "Machine Learning",\n    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning",\n    "content": "Machine learning (ML) is a field of AI concerned with algorithms that learn from data and generalise to unseen inputs without explicit instructions. Supervised learning uses labelled training data. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabelled data. Reinforcement learning trains agents through reward signals. Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers. Training uses backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. Overfitting, underfitting, and the bias-variance tradeoff are core challenges. Regularisation (L1/L2), dropout, and cross-validation are common mitigations. Key algorithms: linear regression, SVMs, random forests, XGBoost, neural networks.

Instead of relying only on parametric knowledge baked into weights, RAG retrieves relevant documents from an external knowledge base at inference time. Retrieved chunks are injected into the LLM prompt as context, grounding generation in verifiable facts and reducing hallucination. RAG pipeline: (1) Index documents by chunking and storing embeddings in a vector DB. (2) Embed the user query and retrieve top-k similar chunks. (3) Inject chunks into the prompt. (4) LLM generates a grounded answer. RAG was introduced by Lewis et al. (2020) at Facebook AI Research. Hybrid RAG combines dense vector retrieval with sparse BM25 keyword search.

Key features: serverless and pod-based deployment, namespaces for multi-tenancy, real-time upserts, and hybrid dense+sparse search. The API: create an index, upsert (id, values, metadata) tuples, then query. Default similarity metric is cosine; also supports dot product and Euclidean. Free Starter plan: one serverless index, up to 2 GB storage. Serverless query latency is typically 10-50ms.

Architecture: encoder/decoder stacks with multi-head self-attention, feed-forward layers, residual connections, and layer normalisation. Positional encodings inject token order information. Multi-head attention runs multiple heads in parallel capturing different patterns. BERT is encoder-only (classification, NER). GPT is decoder-only (generation). T5 and BART use encoder-decoder (translation, summarisation). Scaling laws show performance improves predictably with model size, data, and compute.

Static embeddings: Word2Vec (2013), GloVe (2014), FastText (2016). Contextual embeddings (BERT, ELMo) produce different vectors for the same word depending on context, dramatically improving task performance. Sentence embeddings extend this to full sentences. OpenAI text-embedding-3-small produces 1536-dimensional vectors, costs $0.02 per million tokens, and is widely used for semantic search and RAG. Cosine similarity is the standard metric. Embedding quality is measured by the MTEB (Massive Text Embedding Benchmark).

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities: port congestion, container shortages, factory shutdowns, and semiconductor scarcity caused widespread shortages and inflation. The bullwhip effect describes how small demand variations amplify upstream to cause large production swings. Lean supply chains minimise inventory; resilient chains prioritise redundancy. Digital twins, IoT sensors, and AI-powered demand forecasting improve visibility.

## Discussion & Key Takeaways

**Discussion Questions**
1. What fraction of FAISS latency is the OpenAI embed call vs. the actual FAISS search?
2. For which query types does Azure BM25 help most? (Try exact acronyms like BM25, RRF, HNSW)
3. How would you design Pinecone metadata filters for a multi-tenant SaaS product?
4. At what daily query volume does Cohere rerank latency cost outweigh MRR gain?
5. At 10 million docs, which DB would you choose and why?

**Decision Guide**

| Scenario | Best Choice |
|----------|-------------|
| Prototype / corpus fits in RAM | FAISS -- free, zero-infra, fastest |
| Production serverless, zero-ops | Pinecone -- managed, auto-scales |
| Enterprise + compliance + hybrid text | Azure AI Search -- BM25+vector, RBAC, HIPAA |
| Any DB + quality uplift on top results | + Cohere Rerank |

**Cleanup after the lab**
```python
pc.delete_index(PINECONE_INDEX_NAME)           # remove Pinecone index
idx_client.delete_index(AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME)  # remove Azure index
